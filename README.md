## __1. Overview:__
This project focuses on using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns, identifies key influencing factors, and detects anomalies, ultimately improving energy efficiency.

The study aims to:

- Develop an XGBoost-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score, and Accuracy.
- Provide insights that assist in HVAC optimization, demand-side management, and anomaly detection.
##__2. Implemented Algorithm: XGBoost:__
XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its speed, accuracy, and efficiency. It is particularly useful in smart building energy management because:

- Handles Non-Linear Relationships: Learns complex interactions between factors like occupancy, temperature, and energy usage.
- Regularization Techniques: Prevents overfitting using L1 and L2 regularization.
- High Accuracy: Often outperforms traditional ML models like decision trees and SVM.
- Scalability: Optimized for large datasets, making it suitable for real-time energy forecasting.
### Model Characteristics:
- Boosting Technique: Iteratively improves weak learners to reduce errors.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key drivers of energy consumption.
- Parallel Processing & Memory Efficiency: Optimized for large-scale IoT sensor data in smart buildings.
## __3. Dataset Used:__
The dataset consists of 3,840 records of energy consumption data, including:

- Time-based variables (hour, day, season).
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
- Building-specific data (occupancy, HVAC usage).
